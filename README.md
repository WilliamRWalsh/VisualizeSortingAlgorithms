# VisualizeSortingAlgorithms
I wanted to practice writing a few sorting algorithms in Python and decided it would be interest to see them in action.
### Bubble Sort
Avg. time complexity: 0(n^2)

### Quick Sort
Avg. time complexity: 0(nlog(n))

### Merge Sort
Avg. time complexity: 0(nlog(n))

FYI, Python's default sorting algorithm (.sort()) is a timsort implementation, which is very efficient.
